[2022-04-26 16:49:06.931] [jointLog] [info] Counted 52,141,667 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 16:49:06.954] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000314161% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
