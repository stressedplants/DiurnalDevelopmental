[2022-04-26 19:13:30.451] [jointLog] [info] Counted 35,420,297 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 19:13:30.474] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000275219% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
