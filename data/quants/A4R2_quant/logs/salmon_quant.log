[2022-04-26 16:58:00.560] [jointLog] [info] Counted 43,049,282 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 16:58:00.582] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000219558% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
