[2022-04-26 16:19:59.052] [jointLog] [info] Counted 46,595,965 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 16:19:59.073] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00123342% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
