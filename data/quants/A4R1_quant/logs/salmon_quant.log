[2022-04-26 16:55:35.045] [jointLog] [info] Counted 39,435,235 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 16:55:35.067] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000345195% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
