[2022-04-26 19:01:56.358] [jointLog] [info] Counted 43,824,376 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 19:01:56.378] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000334151% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
