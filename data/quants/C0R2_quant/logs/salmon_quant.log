[2022-04-26 18:16:37.287] [jointLog] [info] Counted 47,011,641 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 18:16:37.307] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000315123% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
