[2022-04-26 17:36:24.852] [jointLog] [info] Counted 53,686,179 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-26 17:36:24.872] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00068559% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 30.
